# Build a Survey Form using HTML and CSS

Forms are always an essential part of any project that is used to collect user input information. In this article, we are creating a survey form for GeeksforGeeks using HTML and CSS. In this form, there are several questions that are asked by users. Here, we will use HTML to design the basic layout of the form and CSS will give a beautiful design to our layout like text-decoration, text color, background color, text alignment, margin, padding, etc. In

Prerequisite: Basic concepts of HTML and CSS like tags, ID, color, margin, padding, font, text field, checkbox, radio button, etc. 

# Approach:

- The <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.

- Inside the form element, provide different options to the user like name, email, age, etc. In HTML, we have different input elements for different tasks. So, we are providing respective input types according to the question (email for taking email input, text-area for taking a large message, name for taking name input, etc.).

- We have also used the radio-button (let a user selection of the provided choices.),check-button (let a user select zero or more options of the provided choices), and submit-button (the button for submitting the form data to a form-handler).
